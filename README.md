# SLSupportVectorMechanism

TASKS:

TASK-1:
  PREPROCESS THE DATA IN SKITLEARN LIBRARY

TASK-2:
  LOAD THE DATA USING sklearn MODEL SELECTION DEFAULT ARGUMENT

TASK-3:
  ON THE BASIS OF THE DATASETS train,test and split YOUR svm MODEL

TASK-4:
  IMPLEMENT SUPPORT_VECTOR_MECHANISM CLASSIFER USING 'svm_classifier'. THE svm MUST BE "LINEAR".

TASK-5:
  TRAIN THE CLASSIFIER ON THE TRAINING DATA 

TASK-6:
  FIND OUT THE PREDICTION VALUE ON THE TEST DATA.

TASK-7:
  TEST THE MODEL WITH THE HELP OF ACCURACY, ACCURACY SHOULD BE LIE IN THE RANGE OF '0 TO 1'
